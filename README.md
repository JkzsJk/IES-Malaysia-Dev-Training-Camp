## 1.0 Introduction
Congratulations! You have been selected to participate in IES Malaysia Dev Training Camp!

This is a **self-paced learning program** for software engineers to pick up **Java development using Spring Boot**, in order to skill up our IES resources.

We have prepared some learning content in the [Google Sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ohy43cKnlYR3JAk5F4YKNpRwl2pUp8Vc1rDrBR8EiYM/edit?usp=sharing) (note: currently the content is only up to Mission 5, we will update it progressively from time to time.)


You will be added to **"IES Malaysia | Dev Training Camp"** team on MS Teams shortly, where we will discuss about more details there.
 

What you need to do:
1. Set up your workstation following the instructions in the Google Sheet.
2. Once ready, take on the mission. Follow the instructions to develop your own Spring Boot application.
3. Upon completing any mission, post to the "Backend Development - Work Submission" channel to notify the facilitators.


If you have any question, feel free to post to the "Backend Development" channel to discuss.
